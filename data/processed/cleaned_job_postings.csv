"The Rockefeller University is the world's leading biomedical research University. Our groundbreaking discoveries in basic and clinical research are transforming medicine. We share a singular commitment to advancing science for the benefit of humanity. Our collaborative culture drives each of us to achieve a higher level, fueling the breakthroughs for which we are known. Many of our most sophisticated cognitive abilities are thought to have evolved to subserve social interactions, yet the underlying computations that make these interactions possible, in all their complexity and nuance, remain elusive. The Price Family Center for the Social Brain (PFCSB) at The Rockefeller University was therefore established to map the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms of social behavior and to use these insights to forge new links between basic and applied neuroscience, with the ultimate goal to alleviate impairments of social brain function.

"About the RoleAmply is an early-stage startup building game-changing software for heat pump pros. Residential buildings represent 20% of all U.S. carbon emissions, of which more than half are related to home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Therefore, retrofitting 80 million home HVAC systems with modern heat pumps is the single biggest residential decarbonization opportunity we have. It is critical we get this once-in-a-generation shift infrastructure and building electrification transition right. Getting it right begins with the right design. Replacing a conventional HVAC system with a heat pump is not a simple ""box swap"" – heat pumps are far more sensitive to sizing and equipment selection assumptions. There are also concerns about aesthetics, rebates, operational costs, and more. For heat pump professionals, often the salesperson, these details end up as hours of ""homework"" on nights and weekends for every project (or they just don’t get done at all). We founded Amply to make the lives of heat pump professionals easier, make homeowners happier, and deliver on the potential of heat pumps to reduce emissions. If we make heat pump pro’s lives easier, they’ll have more capacity to accelerate this generational shift in infrastructure. Homeowners delighted with their heat pumps will spur more rapid adoption. And right-sized systems will improve home comfort and health while minimizing carbon emissions and electric grid impact. We are looking for a mobile engineer who believes in our mission, who loves building beautiful product, who is excited to join a fast-moving, self-motivated team, and who is pumped (pun intended!) about geeking out on heat pumps. This role can be remote anywhere within the United States with a preference for EST timezone (our distributed team is primarily based in the Northeast.)

"Who We Are The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the “network,” which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity. In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud. About The Role We are looking for a Senior Data Engineer superhero who is passionate about building next generation Analytics infrastructures and products.

In addition you will participate on a variety of exciting projects that range from designing robust and fully automated data pipelines to building ML-based applications for improving company-wide productivity and the ThousandEyes product. You have a passion for designing, implementing and operating stable, scalable and efficient solutions that move and analyze large data volumes quickly. You are also a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity, pays close attention to detail and can work in a fast-paced environment.

We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification . Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification.

Today’s cyber-attacks aren’t limited to large organizations with the security tools that can ward off threats.

"Our Company Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobe’s all about. We give everyone—from emerging artists to global brands—everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! We’re passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen. We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours! The Opportunity The Unified Identity service is responsible for storing all of the identity data a customer might need to ingest into the Experience Cloud platform to execute on a use-case. For that reason, it's often referred to as a foundational element of the Platform that is required for any data flow. Identity data is split into two categories. Firstly the IDs themselves. These are used by a number of services and may require explicit consent to collect before they are used. Secondly the links between these IDs. The ID links are used to stitch different first party data sets together to create a robust unified profile. Stitched identities and their associated attributes can then be processed by a number of services to enrich their value (for example profile segmentation). Once processed they are typically activated to provide consistent identity resolution for reporting, attribution and personalization use-cases. Identity resolution is particularly powerful for marketers who are looking to optimize the customer experience for a person that is frequently moving across multiple devices or online and offline touchpoints when completing their customer journey.

"Our client in the edtech industry is looking for a Shopify Developer with proven experience creating custom Shopify features in a fast-paced, remote work environment! ABOUT YOU: You’re an all-around good human being. You’re kind, honest, and trustworthy. You want to work every day with positive, direct people who make you and your day better. No big egos allowed. You value autonomy. You do your best when you’re given lots of responsibility and independence. You thrive in ambiguity and enjoy making decisions. Lots of them. You're resourceful, but you also know when to ask for help. You care deeply about doing great work. You’re always looking for ways to break your own records the next time around. Your teammates know they can always count on you, just like you can count on them. You eat feedback for breakfast. You’re always looking for ways to improve (yourself, the process, the product, you name it), so you give and take feedback with equal grace. THE ROLE You gravitate to simple solutions. You gather as much context as possible so you can propose solutions that address all of the constraints and requirements – with as little overhead as possible. You understand the trade-offs between writing custom code versus leveraging existing Shopify apps to make simple, speedy, and easy-to-maintain solutions to business problems. You communicate well. You understand the underlying business needs behind a feature request. You can clearly communicate your needs – whether that’s timeline expectations or how to be unblocked – and explain key technical decisions to non-technical (but tech-savvy) stakeholders. You’ll teach non-technical members how to use the features you develop, preferably through Loom recordings. You’re detail-oriented. You thoroughly QC every change you make to the Shopify site, to make sure all core functionality always works. You proactively think through edge cases and abuse vectors, and build in ways to mitigate those risks. You’re versatile. You can develop custom Shopify features and apps, integrate and customize existing apps, create custom landing pages, implement pixel tracking, and more. You have good UX design sense, so you don’t need to rely on wireframes or mocks to make customer-facing content that has decent visual hierarchy and alignment. And fast. We always aim for smooth launches, but on the off chance things go awry, you’re ready and willing to put out fires ASAP."
